Renaming variables to use underscores throughout. This makes serialization
easier with the exmaple Python implementation. I think we can explain that one
could keep the dashes in the name with some additional serialization config but
that's outside of the scope for us. I'm planning on having a slide for "changes
to the spec from lesson 1.05"

Removing operationId. Connexion's RestyRouter routes path+method automatically
but will prefer the operationId value if it's set.

Connexion treats "number" in the path as a float so "/talks/1" did not work but
"/talks/1.0" did. I'm not sure if this is connexion-specific but it's not what
we want so I changed it.

<     type: number

>     type: integer
167,168c165,166
<   speaker-id:
<     name: speaker-id

>     name: speaker_id
171c169
<     type: number
---
>     type: integer

Removed id from required fields, otherwise id was required on a POST to create
a new talk. We want the storage to automatically generate the id so remove it
here.

177c175
<     required: [id, title, speaker-id, abstract, duration]
---
>     required: [title, speaker_id, abstract, duration]

Changed the pattern to something that will allow more realistic values for talk
titles. Removed the count range specifier here as the length is being enforced
by the min/max below.

186c184
<         pattern: "[a-zA-Z0-9]{20, 144}"
---
>         pattern: "[A-Za-z0-9 :!\\.]*"
190c188
<       speaker-id:
---
>       speaker_id:

For string types, replaced minimum/maximum with minLength/maxLength.

188,190c186,188
<         minimum: 20
<         maximum: 144
<       speaker-id:
---
>         minLength: 1
>         maxLength: 144
>       speaker_id:

Removed the remaining pattern specs since we don't really want these fields to
be restrictive. We can use the single example above in our lessons.

196,198c194,195
<         pattern: "[a-zA-Z0-9]{100, 500}"
<         minimum: 100
<         maximum: 500
---
>         minLength: 50
>         maxLength: 500

Fixing what looks like a typo:
